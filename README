PVArchive - Masters Project by Chris Martin

This project is an online DVR, extending mythTV.

The web client will be written in Ruby on Rails, the scripts 
to interface with mythTV and encode/process the video files 
will be written in Ruby.

Chris doesn't really know jack about Ruby, so prepare for 
initial suckage.

Misc notes etc. can be found @ wiki.roundhere.net/pvarchive
